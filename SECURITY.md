## Reporting a Vulnerability

Hevelius is currently being developed by a single developer. Tomek
can be reached at thomson (at) klub (dot) com (dot) pl. If you report
a vulnerability, I'll address it as soon as possible. However, keep in mind
that Hevelius is my hobby project and I have full time job and other
family responsibilities.
